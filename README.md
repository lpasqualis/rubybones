# RubyBones #

Skeleton of a simple lightweight Ruby application intended to be used for small projects where you are not interested in carrying the weight of Rails.

The skeleton provides you with all the boiler-plate code that you usually have to write to get started.

Main "features":

* Established code and directory structure.
* Stubs for Bundle and RVM related files.
* Initialization system. Just add initialization files in "initializers" and you are good to go.
* Test environment.
* Simple YML configuration.
* ActiveRecord-ready, for get you going quickly on the creation of an app that requires a DB.
* Migration stubs.

Currently an early-stage work in progress. Feedback, suggestions and pull requests are encouraged.
